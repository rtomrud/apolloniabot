## Introduction

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Apollonia Bot ("the App"), a Discord bot provided by the Apollonia Bot team ("we," "us," or "our"), located in the Balearic Islands, Spain. By using the App, you ("user" or "you") agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App. These Terms incorporate our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md), which explains our data practices.

## Eligibility

You must be at least 14 years old (or the age of digital consent in your country, e.g., 16 in some EU states) to use the App. If under this age, you need parental consent. You confirm you meet these requirements.

## Description of the App

The App is a Discord bot that provides functionality such as responding to user commands within Discord servers. We may update or modify the App at any time without notice.

## User Obligations

Use the App only for lawful purposes and in compliance with [Discord's terms](https://discord.com/terms) and applicable laws.

- Do not misuse the App (e.g., no spamming, hacking, or unauthorized access).
- Do not reverse-engineer, copy, or distribute the App without permission.
- You are responsible for your Discord account and any content you submit.

## Intellectual Property

We own all rights to the App, including code, designs, and trademarks. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not claim ownership or use our IP without written consent.

## Limitations of Liability

The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., loss of data or profits) arising from your use, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our total liability shall not exceed â‚¬0 for free users or the amount you paid us (if any). We are not responsible for third-party services like Discord. In case of disputes, we may limit or suspend your access.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes via our website, app updates, or Discord support server. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

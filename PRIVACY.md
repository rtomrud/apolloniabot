# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

We are the Apollonia Bot team, located at the Balearic Islands, Spain. We are the data controller for any personal data processed by our app, in compliance with EU's GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and Spanish law (Organic Law 3/2018 on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights, or LOPDGDD). Contact us by email at <apolloniabot@gmail.com> for data protection inquiries. No Data Protection Officer (DPO) is appointed as we do not meet the criteria under GDPR Article 37.

## Categories of Personal Data Collected

We process your Discord ID (a "snowflake", a unique numerical identifier from your Discord account) to provide the app's basic functionality. On its own, it does not reveal a person's name, email or any other personally identifiable information. However, we treat it as personal data under GDPR to ensure compliance. No other personal data (e.g., name, email, IP address, or device information) is processed, collected or stored.

## Purposes of Processing and Legal Basis

We process your Discord ID solely for the purpose of providing the app's core functionality, such as responding to a command and replying to the user. Your Discord ID is required to use the app's core features; without it, those features will not function. The legal basis is our legitimate interests under GDPR Article 6(1)(f), as this is necessary for the app to work as intended and does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms (e.g., privacy). You have the right to object to this processing (see "Data Subjects Rights" section below). We do not use your Discord ID for marketing, analytics, or any other purposes.

## Source of Data

Your Discord ID is obtained indirectly from Discord when you interact with our app through their platform.

## Recipients of the Data

Your Discord ID may be shared with Discord Inc., as a third-party service provider, solely to enable the app's core functionality via their API. Discord Inc. acts as a data processor pursuant to Discord's API terms and conditions. No other recipients, including affiliates, authorities, or third parties, receive your data. We do not sell data.

## International Transfers of Data

If your Discord ID is transferred to Discord Inc. (located in the US, outside the EU), we ensure appropriate safeguards or Discord's compliance with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable. No other international transfers occur.

## Data Retention Period

We do not store your Discord ID. It is processed only temporarily during your interactions with the app and is deleted immediately after use. Retention is limited to the duration necessary for the functionality (e.g., seconds or minutes).

## Data Security

We use industry-standard security measures like encryption during transmission of your data. We do not store your data, so no additional security measures are required for storage.

## Data Subject Rights

You have rights under GDPR, including access, rectification, erasure (right to be forgotten), restriction, objection (to processing based on legitimate interests), and data portability. For Spanish users, this includes LOPDGDD digital rights (e.g., right to digital disconnection). Contact us by email at <apolloniabot@gmail.com> to exercise rights. Since we do not store data, requests may result in confirmation that no data is held.

## Right to Lodge a Complaint

You can lodge a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) at www.aepd.es (Address: C/ Jorge Juan 6, 28001 Madrid, Spain) or any EU supervisory authority to exercise your rights under the GDPR.

## Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

We do not do any automated decision-making or profiling based on your Discord ID.
